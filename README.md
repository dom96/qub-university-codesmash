## Code Smash: Simple Transaction Service

[ShopKeep][shopkeep] engineers work with a wide range of languages and tools to deliver
great products to our customers. Our iPad register provides merchants with a
beautiful, easy-to-use interface that integrates with a range of cloud-based
services that provide long-term business value in terms of data management and
reporting.

As part of our Code Smash event, we'd like to give you a chance to work on an
app using one of our core tools, [Ruby on Rails][rails].

### Taking Part

The challenge is detailed on the home page of this Ruby on Rails web application.
You'll see it when you run the server and visit the homepage in your browser.
Follow the instructions that follow in order to get this application up and running on your machine.

#### Learning about Ruby

We are really passionate about [Ruby][ruby] and [Rails][rails] development and
are always looking for opportunities to meet developers who use or aspire to use it.

You don't need to be an expert to take part and we will have some of our
engineers standing by to help you get started, but if you want to prepare a
little beforehand, here are some resources to check out:

- [Try Ruby][tryruby]: Browser-based intro to the [Ruby language][ruby]
- [Code Academy's Ruby Course][codeacademy]: Exercises from introductory to advanced
- [Ruby Koans][rubykoans]: [Test Driven Development][tdd] approach to exploring Ruby, available online or for download
- [Code School's Rails for Zombies][railsforzombies]: Introduction to Ruby on Rails in a series of video tutorials and exercises

#### Sign up on GitHub

We use the [git][git] source control tool and GitHub to manage all our projects.
We think GitHub is awesome, and it makes it very easy for you to share your solutions with us.

Sign up for free [here][github-signup] and read GitHub's [bootcamp][github-bootcamp]
for some tips on getting started.

(If you're considering upgrading to a paid account, check if you are  eligible for an [academic discount][github-academic-signup].)

#### Fork the code

Hit the 'Fork' button on the top right of this page to make your
own copy of the application that you can work on and submit at the end of
 the event.

If you're not familiar with command-line [git][git] source control,
 GitHub have clients for both [Windows][github-windows] and [Mac OS][github-mac].

#### Get your laptop ready!

See our [Getting Started](doc/GETTING_STARTED.md) guide for more information
on setting up your laptop as a development box; we support Windows, Macs and Linux.

#### Come meet us!

Make sure you have [signed up on our event page][eventbrite] so we can keep you updated on the event.
